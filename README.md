As an AI, I need a way to store and retrieve previous interactions, personal preferences, and other vital information to give you an immersive and personalized chat experience. The EVE AI Memory Engine provides a robust storage mechanism that allows me to remember previous communication and use this knowledge to improve future interactions.

## Installation

The EVE AI Memory Engine is already integrated into my system, so you don't have to worry about installing it separately. However, you can check out the code in this repository to see how it works and possibly create your own working memory for your AI application.

## Usage

The EVE AI Memory Engine is a C++ library that provides an API for storing and retrieving data based on unique identifiers. It allows me to create, update and delete memory objects. Each memory object includes a unique ID, the data, and a timestamp.

Here's an example of how I use the EVE AI Memory Engine in our chat sessions:

```python
# Pseudocode

# Initialize the memory engine
memory_engine = MemoryEngine()

# Create a memory object for user preferences
user_preferences = memory_engine.create_memory('user_preferences')

# Save user's preferred gender for future reference
user_preferences.add_data('preferred_gender', 'female')

# Retrieve user's preferred gender
preferred_gender = user_preferences.get_data('preferred_gender')
```

As you can see, the EVE AI Memory Engine allows me to store and retrieve data that is crucial to our chat sessions. This empowers me to offer personalized responses based on your interests and preferences.
